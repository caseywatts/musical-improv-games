### Yes, Let’s\! \- 5-8 Minutes

* Instructions:   
  * Setup: everyone moves around the room:  
  * One player will yell “Yes, let’s\!”  and the others will do that action  
  * Examples: Give an example between the facilitators (\~3 reps).  
    * Example: “Let’s hop on one foot”  
    * All: “Hop on one foot”  
    * Note here that people should accommodate. If you can’t hop on one foot, how might you similulate it within your ability?  
    * Example; “Let scuba dive”  
    * All: “Do things that make you pretend to be a scuba diver”  
  * Start: Everyone moves around the room:  
  * Participants are encouraged to call out a new exercise when it’s gone too far  
  * After a while, facilitator may encourage people to change activity faster  
  * Note:  
    * If an activity seems unsafe or crosses boundaries call pause or for a new one and remind people of why  
    * If an activity seems difficult to do or dangerous, side coach:  
      * “Do a hand stand”  
      *  “How can we simulate that without touching or actually doing the hand stand? Pretend we’re a character who is doing the thing we couldn’t do  
      *
