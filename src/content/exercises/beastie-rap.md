### BEASTIE RAP CIRCLE

* Instructions:   
  * Players in a circle  
  * Player A starts by rapping a simple line with an unstress-stress pattern, like:  
    * "LIVing at HOME is SUCH a DRAG."	  
  * Everyone responds with the Beastie Rap pattern:  
    * "DAH duh-duh-DAH Duh-DAH duh-DAH DAH\!"  
  * Each player in turn comes up with a simple line that fits the rhythm and rhymes with Player A's original line.   
  * The Beastie Rap is repeated between each line.  
  * If a player fails to come up with a line, they say "Aww shit" and the failing player starts a new round with a new word to rhyme with.  
  * When the players not rapping can predict the rhyme word of the active player coming, they all join in and yell the word together\! At the end of every line

### BEASTIE RAP BATTLE

#### Beastie Rap: 5 \- 10 Minutes

* Purpose: Get everybody feeling goofy, rhythmic, and collaborative, with a sprinkle of groupmind  
* Instructions:   
  * Setup: Divide everyone into two parallel lines and designate one side as the “front” of the lines  
  * This game is like a rap battle, except that the person in the front of each line is trying to get the rest of their team to say a single word that rhymes with a name given by the audience  
  * Facilitator can demonstrate the execution of part of a round. They will act as the front/leader of their team for a single turn. (Another facilitator can act as the front/leader of the other team) They will get a one syllable name from the audience and then show the back and forth that will happen between the teams.  
  * EXAMPLE:  
    * Facilitator 1 gets a one syllable name, ex. Jay  
    * Facilitator 1 says, “I once had a friend and his name was…”  
    * Then the rest of their team says “Jay\!”  
    * We all wait for a measure  
    * Now the other facilitator needs to setup a line that will rhyme with Jay  
    * Facilitator 2 says, “Please don’t leave, I want you to…”  
    * Now hopefully their team all says “stay\!”  
    * Then the back and forth continues until one team messes up  
  * Participants are encouraged to keep the beat by tapping their feet  
  * There is a little tune we can mumble during the resting measure (we can demonstrate it in person, no point in try to write it down here lol)  
  * When a team messes up, their leader goes to the back and everyone on that team rotates one position  
* Notes:  
  * As long as everyone who speaks on a team says the same word and the word rhymes with the original name, then the game keeps going. So if the front/leader sets up a line for their 5 team mates, and 2 of them are so confused that they stay silent but the 3 that did speak up all say the same thing, that counts as a valid turn  
  * We can be permissive of some slight slant rhymes, but we encourage people to not make that slant too big  
  * If you are the leader of your team, make sure you aren’t saying the rhyme as well  
  * There isn’t a definite end to the game, we can cut it off whenever we feel it has gotten people loosened up and such
