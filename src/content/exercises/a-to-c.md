### **DA DO RON RON ELIMINATION**

* Instructions:  
  * Players in a circle or in a line that cycles around  
  * Explain that players take turns offering a new original rhyme in the rhythm of the song. Each new verse continues the same AAAAA rhyme scheme Example  
  * Example  
    * Player A: “I met him on a Monday, and his name was Pete.”  
      * Everyone: “Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron”

    * The song continues to the next verse with a new rhyme  
    * The song should get faster over time (it probably will naturally anyway)  
    * This continues until someone can’t produce a rhyme  
    * When someone fails they are eliminated, and a new song starts  
    * This goes until just one person survives, and they are the winner  
* Notes:  
  * Remember to let the song get faster and faster as a round goes on  
  * When starting off the rhyme, don’t purposefully use an unrhymable word just to spite others.

* Purpose: Players work on rhythm, listening, and pitch

### **Exercise: Gibberish Pitches Part 2 \- 5-8 minutes**

* Instructions:  
  * Optional round 1 with no piano. All other rounds the piano accompaniment will move around to different chords and rhythms throughout\!  
  * Practice listening and making a variation\!  
  * Facilitators will demonstrate the following:  
    * Setup: In a circle formation:  
    * PLAYER ONE: SAME AS BEFORE:  
      * Step forward and perform a short gibberish melody  
    * PLAYER TWO:  
      * Repeat the FIRST HALF of the previous player’s melody as accurately as possible.  
      * Then, invent a NEW SECOND HALF to complete the melody.  
    * PLAYER TWO: Perform a new melody for the THIRD player.  
  * Continue around the circle in this way  
  * The game should continue until every player has had a turn.  
* Example:

  * Facilitator may intervene to make sure there is a smooth transition between players  
* Purpose: Players work on rhythm, listening, and pitch

### **Discussion Melody \- 5 minutes**

* Ask the group for their takeaways and thoughts.  
* Discussion points:  
  * LISTEN AND RESPOND: One way to create a new melody is to listen to the previous melody and respond to it with a new idea. Varying the rhythm, pitch, or overall feel  
  * EXPERIMENT WITH DIFFERENT SOUNDS: Experiment with different sounds and vocalizations when creating their melodies. This could involve using different vowel sounds, consonants, or even animal noises to create interesting and unexpected melodies.  
  * PLAY WITH REPETITION: Repetition of pitch and rhythm can be a powerful tool in creating melodies. Experiment with repeating certain sounds or phrases to create a sense of structure or continuity in their melody.  
  * FOLLOW THE FEELING: Sometimes the best way to create a melody is to simply follow the feeling of the music and let it guide you. Tap into your intuition and allow their melodies to evolve naturally in response to the piano accompaniment and the group energy.  
  * TAKE RISKS: Finally, this is an improv game, and there are no wrong answers\! Take risks and try new things when creating melodies, and embrace the unexpected twists and turns that can arise as a result.

# **In The Studio**

[Edit on Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1kQrK_o9JiRsGuCM0cAKLlz9jJjJIAKBfgm_ip8SkRLI/edit)

### **In The Studio**

* Instructions:  
  * Three singers, a producer, and an accompanist needed, optional mic stand  
  * Get the name of some famous (usually children’s) song from the audience  
  * Producer tells singers to record a neutral track, accompanist starts playing  
  * The three singers perform the song like normal  
  * The producer says they want to try the song a different way, usually genre-wise  
  * The accompanist starts playing, one of the three singers takes the lead  
  * The lead sings a little of the original song, but they mostly come up with lyrics  
  * This is then repeated for the other two singers  
  * After the third recording, the producer says they’ve got all they need  
* Example:  
  * Singer 1: “Someone give me a song you remember from your childhood.”  
  * Audience: “Wheels on the Bus”  
  * Producer: “Alright everyone, let’s get a nice clean, neutral track to start off”

  * This happens two more times so that all three singers get to be the lead  
  * Producer: “Alright, that last take was golden, thank you very much”  
* Notes:  
  * It’s best for the final song to have the most emotion and volume.  
  * The producer is encouraged to have a little bit of back and forth with the singers between songs.  
  * While a singer is leading, the other two singers stand a step or two back and provide backup dancing/vocals.

# **Irish Drinking Song**

[Edit on Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HOe5qE3tylr3xS7s7G2TtWGqmAM8-15kDXHHiq5nCE8/edit)

### **Irish Drinking Song**

* Objective: Make a rhyming and rotating Irish drinking song  
* Instructions:  
  * Four singers needed, accompanist is technically optional but is very helpful  
  * The singers will get some suggestion from the audience, any type is fine  
  * The singers will get in a row and then make up a song, one line at a time  
  * The lines follow a specific rhyming pattern, and there is rotation involved  
  * The whole song consists of 4 sets of 8 lines, each set containing 2 rhymes  
  * In between each set, a specific tune is repeated, then a “rotation” occurs  
  * ENTIRE song line structure (“\~” \= non-rhyming line, letters \= lines that rhyme):  
    \~A\~A\~B\~B \~C\~C\~D\~D \~E\~E\~F\~F \~G\~G\~H\~H  
* Example:  
  * Assume musical accompaniment and an audience suggestion of ‘video games’  
  * All 4 Singers: “Oooh eye dee-die dee-die dee-die dee-die dee-die dee-die”  
  * Singer 1: “I love to play video games”  
  * Singer 2: “They are very fun.”  
  * Singer 3: “I’ve played them now for years”  
  * Singer 4: “In fact, I’m number one”  
  * Singer 1: “I’m the best player in the land”  
  * Singer 2: “I am the world champ”  
  * Singer 3: “I’ve become so famous”  
  * Singer 4: “They even put me on a stamp”  
  * All 4 Singers: “Oooh eye dee-die dee-die dee-die dee-die dee-die dee-die”  
  * Singer 2: “One time I was playing Pac-Man”  
  * Singer 3: “And a crowd started to form”  
  * Singer 4: “I was on my ‘A’ game”  
  * Singer 1: “And then it started to storm”  
  * Singer 2: “The power began to flicker”  
  * Singer 3: “And I began to sweat”  
  * Singer 4: “We lost electricity”  
  * Singer: “And then my pants, I did wet”  
  * All 4 Singers: “Oooh eye dee-die dee-die dee-die dee-die dee-die dee-die”  
  * \*The next 8 lines are given in singer order 34123412\*  
  * All 4 Singers: “Oooh eye dee-die dee-die dee-die dee-die dee-die dee-die”  
  * \*The next 8 lines are given in singer order 41234123\*  
  * All 4 Singers: “Oooh eye dee-die dee-die dee-die dee-die dee-die dee-die, oh eye dee-die dee-die dee-die dee-die dee die dee diiiiiiiieeeeeeee”  
* Notes:  
  * \!\!\! It’s easier to get the hang of the structure by watching the linked video \!\!\!  
  * Staying on rhythm is pretty important in this game. If you find yourself about to stray from the beat, just make sure you say a single word (or just a syllable) at the end of the line so as to not knock the next person off beat.  
  * It helps to pretend you’re holding a beer and sway your arm to the beat.  
  * If you are the person setting up the line that another person will rhyme with, make sure your final word is something relatively easy to rhyme with.  
* Video reference: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUx6fFRlYnw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUx6fFRlYnw)  
  * In this instance they tell a story, this isn’t required, but it is impressive\!

(variation) have the first person go to the end, so that there is less confusion

Musical Zip Zap Zop  
Objective: Develop spontaneous musical creativity and group cohesion by evolving spoken words into melodies and rhythms, with a focus on passing sounds and motions to different players.

Instructions:

* Minimum of three players, but this works well with larger groups.  
* Players form a circle. The exercise involves singing and passing sounds to different players in a structured sequence.

Example:  
Round 1: Simple Sounds

* Player 1 starts by singing “Zip” in a simple melody and points to Player 2\.  
* Player 2 responds by singing “Zap” in a different melody and points to Player 3\.  
* Player 3 finishes with “Zop” in their own melody and points to a new player.

Each group of sounds their sound 2-3 times before passing it to the next player.

* Player 2 continues with a melody for “Zap,” like “Zaaap-la,” and points to Player 3\.  
* Player 3 follows with a melody for “Zop,” such as “Zoop-bop,” and points to a new player.

Repeat each melody 2-3 times while passing between players, ensuring each new player receives the melody.

Round 3: Longer Melodies

* Players extend their melodies, making them more complex.  
* Player 1 creates a longer melody for “Zip,” such as “Ziiip-doo-wop,” and points to Player 2\.  
* Player 2 sings a more intricate melody for “Zap,” like “Zaaap-la-daa,” and points to Player 3\.  
* Player 3 ends with an extended melody for “Zop,” such as “Zoop-bop-a-lop,” and points to a new player.

Repeat each extended melody several times, passing it between players each time a new person is pointed to.

Notes:

## **Game Notes**

### **Objective**

Collaborate to create rhyming and communicating an idea.

Each player must rhyme their first word with the last word of the previous player’s sentence while providing a helpful clue for the next player to continue the rhyme.

Each part is an even beat of seven syllables. Find the beat by counting slowly and evenly

### **Instructions**

Participants sit or stand in a circle.

Facilitator can first lead everyone in a slow even beat, so participants understand the rhythm

Player 1 starts by saying a sentence or phrase that ends with a word to rhyme. They start a sentence with a clue so that the next player’s first wordcan rhyme with that last word.

Each player’s second sentence or phrase provides a clue to help the next person come up with the correct rhyme.

Player 2 then provides a sentence that starts with a rhyming word and ends with a new word for the next player to rhyme.

And so on around the circle.

The game is collaborative, so help each other if someone is stuck.

Continue for a set number of rounds or until everyone has had a turn multiple times.

### **Example**

Player 1: “There is nothing to buy in this STORE. I’ll show you around my house in a…”

Player 2: “TOUR of the best places you can SEE. I like to relax in the shade of a…”

Player 3: “TREE, where the breeze feels so FINE. I stay on my side and not cross the…”

### **Soundscapes**

* Instructions:  
  * Everyone \- Gather in a circle. We will be creating a musical soundscape with no words allowed.  
  * In no particular order the first player will start by making a sound, any sound they choose. It could be a vocal sound, a hand clap, or anything else that makes noise.  
  * One at a time in no order, each person adds their own sound to the mix, building on the first sound. Imitate the first sound or create something new\!  
  * The next players continue to add their own sounds, each player building on the previous sounds to create a layered musical soundscape.  
  * As the soundscape builds, players should work to make the sounds harmonize and blend together, creating a cohesive musical piece.  
  * Once the soundscape has reached a crescendo, players can work together to bring it to a satisfying conclusion.  
  * Ask the group for a place or event where many people might gather  
  * Rounds:  
    * For the second round, some players will be allowed to use words \- organically.  
    * Repeat the same process as before, with players building on each other’s sounds and incorporating words where appropriate.

    * PERSON B says their own name and pose  
    * PERSON B says PERSON C’s name and pose  
    * etc  
* Notes:  
  * There is a mind/body connection in all things and improv is no different\!  
  * Superhero Poses gives us a chance to move our bodies, get the blood flowing, and connect with each other all at once.  
  * This is also another chance to get familiar with each others’ names and get used to speaking in front of the group which will help to build trust and comfort\!  
  * Spelling names is another way to help ourselves remember.

The Midnight Society Opening:

Objective: To create an engaging and collaborative spooky story through group participation and scenic moments, with an optional musical variant.

Instructions:

Get a suggestion of anything at all.

Form a Crescent of Doom by having players stand in an arch formation.

A player starts by announcing they have a scary story to share. They give the basic premise in one or two lines.

Other players add to the story, behaving as if it’s the scariest story ever.

Once the basic story is set, two player steps out. They perform a three to four line scene that advances the plot.

Optionally, after the scene, the 2 players can break into a musical number. They sing a four-line chorus about the story. The ensemble repeats the chorus.

Return to the Crescent of Doom. Another player introduces a new scary story based on the original suggestion.

Tell a total of three stories.

Remember to comment on the new details discovered after each little scene.

At the end of the third story, everyone says together: “Submitted for the approval of the Midnight Society, we give you… (SUGGESTION)\!”

Example:

Round 1: A player announces a story about a haunted mirror. Other players add spooky elements.

A scenic moment shows the mirror revealing a ghost. Optionally, players sing a chorus like “Haunted Mirror” or “Ghostly Reflections,” which the ensemble repeats.

Round 2: Another player introduces a story about a cursed doll. The scene involves a child receiving the doll as a gift.

A musical number follows with a chorus like “Cursed Doll” or “Doll’s Curse.”

Round 3: A final story is about a mysterious, disappearing bridge. The scene shows people trying to cross the bridge only for it to vanish.

The ensemble sings a chorus like “Vanishing Bridge” or “Bridge of Shadows.”

2. staying on rhythm

I like Song Soup and Bad Rap.

Song Soup is just a circle and someone steps in and starts singing a real song (or a made-up one). When someone is inspired by a word, a line, or anything, they can jump in and start a new song. The loose flow of it is nice and relaxing and there's no pressure to jump in x amount of times.

Bad Rap is great because you set up a clear rhyme and the next person has to not complete it. Like this, A- "My lady just dumped me and I'm in a lot of pain. The sky is grey and I wish it would..." B- "Clear up\!" "(sets up next rhyme)." You can do it with shorter set-ups if you like. It's a lot of fun and good practice for setting up obvious rhymes.  
Jazzy Jibberish is just scatting over a melody. Everyone stands in a circle and takes four bars to come up with jibberish before passing on the the next person. Low stress and a good way to warm up. Musical accompaniment helps a lot.

One Word or Two Word at a time is traditionally a story told by people standing in a circle. Each person adds one or two words to the story and then next person picks it up. It helps to go fast and not think too much. We then use the same format, but as a song. I prefer giving everyone two words instead of one because it gives a little more flexibility and room to play.
