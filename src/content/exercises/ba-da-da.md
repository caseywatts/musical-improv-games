2. Rhythmically (slow)  
   1. Clap rhythmically \- hands to thighs, hands together to clap  
   2. It’s natural to speed up \- try to keep it slow for this round  
   3. Much more important to stay on beat\! You don’t have to make sense.  
3. Rhythmically (faster\!)  
   1. Do it faster\!  
   2. Go off the rails, be silly\!
