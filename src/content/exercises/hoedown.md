### Hoedown

* Objective: Each person sings a distinct, four-line, rhyming chorus about some topic  
* Instructions:   
  * At least four singing improvisers and one accompanist needed  
  * The singers stand side to side facing the audience and get any suggestion  
  * Each person sings a verse with an AABB rhyme scheme based on the topic  
  * After the last person finishes, everyone repeats their last several words  
* Example:  
  * Singer 1: “Can I get an occupation?”  
  * Audience: “Bus Driver”  
  * \*Accompanist starts playing melody\*  
  * Singer 1: “I love driving a bus, it’s such an exciting job”  
  * Singer 1: “I get to wear a hat, and a nametag that says Bob”  
  * Singer 1: “Gotta watch my speed, or else I will make skids”  
  * Singer 1: “I get so excited I forget to pick up the kids”  
  * \*Accompanist plays little interlude\*  
  * \*Singer 2 sings an unrelated verse based on the audience suggestion\*  
  * \*Singer 3 sings\*  
  * \*Singer 4 sings and their verse happens to end with “I ran them over”\*  
  * Every singer: “I ran them oveeeeeeeeeer\!”  
* Notes:  
  * People that are more comfortable with rhyming should go first.  
  * Both rhymes don’t need to be funny/punchy, but it’s better to focus more energy on the second rhyme   
  * Think of the words you want to rhyme with first, then work backwards to think what your whole lines should be.  
  * Sometimes it can be funny to (lightly) tease other players with your song.
