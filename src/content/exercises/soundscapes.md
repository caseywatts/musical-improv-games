### Soundscapes

* Instructions:   
  * Everyone \- Gather in a circle. We will be creating a musical soundscape with no words allowed.  
  * In no particular order the first player will start by making a sound, any sound they choose. It could be a vocal sound, a hand clap, or anything else that makes noise.  
  * One at a time in no order,  each person adds their own sound to the mix, building on the first sound. Imitate the first sound or create something new\!  
  * The next players continue to add their own sounds, each player building on the previous sounds to create a layered musical soundscape.  
  * As the soundscape builds, players should work to make the sounds harmonize and blend together, creating a cohesive musical piece.  
  * Once the soundscape has reached a crescendo, players can work together to bring it to a satisfying conclusion.  
  * Ask the group for a place or event where many people might gather  
  * Rounds:  
    * For the second round, some players will be allowed to use words \- organically.  
    * Repeat the same process as before, with players building on each other's sounds and incorporating words where appropriate.  
    * Encourage players to listen to each other and work together to create a musical soundscape that is interesting and enjoyable to listen to.
