### Irish Drinking Song

* Objective: Make a rhyming and rotating Irish drinking song  
* Instructions:   
  * Four singers needed, accompanist is technically optional but is very helpful  
  * The singers will get some suggestion from the audience, any type is fine  
  * The singers will get in a row and then make up a song, one line at a time  
  * The lines follow a specific rhyming pattern, and there is rotation involved  
  * The whole song consists of 4 sets of 8 lines, each set containing 2 rhymes  
  * In between each set, a specific tune is repeated, then a “rotation” occurs  
  * ENTIRE song line structure (“\~” \= non-rhyming line, letters \= lines that rhyme):  
    \~A\~A\~B\~B   \~C\~C\~D\~D   \~E\~E\~F\~F   \~G\~G\~H\~H  
* Example:  
  * Assume musical accompaniment and an audience suggestion of ‘video games’  
  * All 4 Singers: “Oooh eye dee-die dee-die dee-die dee-die dee-die dee-die”  
  * Singer 1: “I love to play video games”  
  * Singer 2: “They are very fun.”  
  * Singer 3: “I’ve played them now for years”  
  * Singer 4: “In fact, I’m number one”  
  * Singer 1: “I’m the best player in the land”  
  * Singer 2: “I am the world champ”  
  * Singer 3: “I’ve become so famous”  
  * Singer 4: “They even put me on a stamp”  
  * All 4 Singers: “Oooh eye dee-die dee-die dee-die dee-die dee-die dee-die”  
  * Singer 2: “One time I was playing Pac-Man”  
  * Singer 3: “And a crowd started to form”  
  * Singer 4: “I was on my ‘A’ game”  
  * Singer 1: “And then it started to storm”  
  * Singer 2: “The power began to flicker”  
  * Singer 3: “And I began to sweat”  
  * Singer 4: “We lost electricity”  
  * Singer: “And then my pants, I did wet”  
  * All 4 Singers: “Oooh eye dee-die dee-die dee-die dee-die dee-die dee-die”  
  * \*The next 8 lines are given in singer order 34123412\*  
  * All 4 Singers: “Oooh eye dee-die dee-die dee-die dee-die dee-die dee-die”  
  * \*The next 8 lines are given in singer order 41234123\*  
  * All 4 Singers: “Oooh eye dee-die dee-die dee-die dee-die dee-die dee-die, oh eye dee-die dee-die dee-die dee-die dee die dee diiiiiiiieeeeeeee”  
* Notes:  
  * \!\!\! It’s easier to get the hang of the structure by watching the linked video \!\!\!  
  * Staying on rhythm is pretty important in this game. If you find yourself about to stray from the beat, just make sure you say a single word (or just a syllable) at the end of the line so as to not knock the next person off beat.  
  * It helps to pretend you’re holding a beer and sway your arm to the beat.  
  * If you are the person setting up the line that another person will rhyme with, make sure your final word is something relatively easy to rhyme with.  
* Video reference: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUx6fFRlYnw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUx6fFRlYnw)  
  * In this instance they tell a story, this isn’t required, but it is impressive\!
