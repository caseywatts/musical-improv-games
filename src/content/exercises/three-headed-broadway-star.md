### Three-Headed Broadway Star

* Objective: Use groupmind to sing a song to an audience member one word at a time  
* Instructions:   
  * Three singing improvisers, one accompanist, and one audience member needed  
  * The three singers will stand behind the audience member who sits in a chair  
  * Get a fake broadway musical name, then from that musical get a fake song name  
  * The three singers then sing that song to the audience member one word at a time  
  * Eventually (\~ 2 minutes) the last word should be sung in unison  
* Example:  
  * Singer 1: “Can I get a member of the audience? Don’t worry, you just need to sit”  
  * Singer 2: “Can I get a name for an unlikely Broadway musical?”  
  * Audience: “The Tale of Athlete’s Foot”  
  * Singer 3: “Can I get the name of the hit song from ‘The Tale of Athlete’s Foot’?”  
  * Audience: “No Sole Left Behind”  
  * Accompanist starts playing music for “No Sole Left Behind”  
  * Singer 1: “You”  
  * Singer 2: “Captured”  
  * Singer 3: “My”  
  * Singer 1: “Sole”  
  * Singer 2: “When”  
  * \*this one word cyclical pattern continues until the last word\*  
  * All 3 singers” “Behiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiind\!\!\!” (or whatever the word is)  
* Notes:  
  * The singers should be encouraged to stay on rhythm, but to not fret too much if they fall off track. It’s easy to get back on rhythm if you just accept that you deviated and not worry or apologize for it.  
  * If someone accidentally says multiple words, just quickly correct yourself by repeating only the first word that you said.  
  * The song should be about the audience member (ie. addressed to them).  
  * It is more impressive when rhyming occurs, but it’s not a requirement.  
* Video reference: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XajUL5LdKxg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XajUL5LdKxg)  
  * Their “get” for the song title is a little simpler and could also be used rather than the one mentioned here
