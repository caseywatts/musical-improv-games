### In The Studio

* Objective: Sing a (usually children’s) song in different styles like you’re in the studio  
* Instructions:   
  * Three singers, a producer, and an accompanist needed, optional mic stand  
  * Get the name of some famous (usually children’s) song from the audience  
  * Producer tells singers to record a neutral track, accompanist starts playing  
  * The three singers perform the song like normal  
  * The producer says they want to try the song a different way, usually genre-wise  
  * The accompanist starts playing, one of the three singers clearly takes the lead  
  * The lead sings a little of the original song, but they mostly come up with lyrics  
  * This is then repeated for the other two singers  
  * After the third recording, the producer says they’ve got all they need  
* Example:  
  * Singer 1: “Someone give me a song you remember from your childhood.”  
  * Audience: “Wheels on the Bus”  
  * Producer: “Alright everyone, let’s get a nice clean, neutral track to start off”  
  * Accompanist starts playing music and all three singers sing Wheels on the Bus  
  * Producer: “Alright, let’s try that again but with some grunge thrown in there”  
  * Accompanist plays and Singer 1 songs Wheels on the Bus in a grunge style  
  * This happens two more times so that all three singers get to be the lead  
  * Producer: “Alright, that last take was golden, thank you very much”  
* Notes:  
  * Commitment to the producer’s suggestions is key.  
  * Change the lyrics (a lot) when doing the re-recordings.  
  * It’s best for the final song to have the most emotion and volume.  
  * The producer is encouraged to have a tiny bit of back and forth with the singers between songs.  
  * While a singer is leading, the other two singers stand a step or two back and provide backup dancing/vocals.
