### Musical Freeze

* Objectives:  
  * Physical Movement \- Must keep moving at all times in a scene  
  * Support \- Don’t leave people in the circle so long  
  * Quick Decisions \- Based on the pose, make a quick initiation and yes and   
* Two performers will start a scene frozen in a pose  
* The pianist will play and they will create sung dialog  
  * Freeform two-person “sung scenes”.   
  * Forget the verses and choruses\! Just for fun.   
  * Actively move/pose/activity while on stage singing.  
* At any time another performer can yell “freeze” \- even mid-line  
  * When a freeze is called all performers in the scene must immediately freeze in whatever position they find themselves in.   
* They choose one of the performers in the scene to replace  
* They assume their frozen pose.  
* Try to justify the pose you are in to inspire the new scene

  * This is the non-musical version of the game, we would just sing rather than talk
