## Notes

1. Always make sure to keep to the beat. It’s better to sacrifice content or other things in your line, because that is easier to “recover” from than losing the beat.  
2. You only have to say a little bit on your turn, you don’t need to give a lot of details. The details and the stakes of the narrative will develop collectively.  
3. If it feels like the song should end, be unambiguous when you end it. Clearly step forward, slow your tempo, increase your volume, and hold your last note.
