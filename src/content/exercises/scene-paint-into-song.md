Scene Paint into Song

Objective: Create a scene by describing three distinct "spaces" based on a suggestion, transitioning into a song or series of songs inspired by the scene painting.

Instructions:

1\. Suggestion: A player steps out and asks the audience for a suggestion of a location or setting.

2\. Space Description: The first player decides whether to present in a "Narrative" style or in character. 

Narrative means describing the space as if narrating a scene in a story or documentary, using descriptive language to paint a vivid picture of the setting without embodying a specific role or character.

In Character means describing the space from the perspective of a character who is interacting with or inhabiting the setting, using dialogue or reactions that reflect the character’s experience and personality. 

Begin with “We are in a X” for narrative or “Welcome to my X” for character. Players tag in and out to describe the space. Focus on physical descriptions of the space; some emotional tone is fine but avoid putting people in the environment.

3\. Sweep Edit:

4\. Song Creation: Create a song or series of songs inspired by the scene painting.   
Examples:

Example 1: Amusement Park in Character style

Player 1: “Welcome to my amusement park\!”

Player 2 tags in: “Over here we have the roller coasters twisting high into the sky.”

Player 3 tags in: “This area is filled with game booths and colorful prizes.”

Player 2 tags in: “And here’s the food court, with smells of popcorn and cotton candy.”

Sweep edit and transition to song: Song about the excitement of the park, the thrill of rides, and the fun of games.

Example 2: Space Station in narrative style

Player 1: “We are in a space station orbiting Earth.”

Player 2 tags in: “This part of the station has large windows showing a breathtaking view of the planet.”

Player 3 tags in: “Here we have the laboratory with scientific equipment floating around.”

Player 2 tags in: “And over here is the sleeping quarters with floating beds.”

Sweep edit and transition to song: Song about the wonders of space, the view of Earth, and life in zero gravity.

Example 3: Haunted House 

Player 1: “Welcome to my haunted house\!”

Player 2 tags in: “This room is dark with cobwebs and eerie creaking sounds.”

Player 3 tags in: “Over here, there’s a grand piano playing by itself.”

Player 2 tags in: “And this room has ghostly figures and chilling drafts.”

Sweep edit and transition to song: Song about the spooky atmosphere, ghostly sounds, and the thrill of a haunted house.

Notes: Keep the scene descriptions concise and focused on physical elements.   
Transition smoothly between spaces and ensure each description is clear. The song should reflect the themes and moods of the described spaces.
