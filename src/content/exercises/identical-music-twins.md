* Instructions:   
  * Two improvisers, one accompanist, and one audience member needed  
  * The two singers will stand behind the audience member who sits in a chair  
  * Get any sort of suggestion from the audience  
  * The two singers will then sing an inspired song to the audience member  
  * The singers should sing the exact same words at the exact same time
