### Greatest Hits

* Objective: Improvise an infomercial that is selling a niche musical CD  
* Instructions:   
  * Two hosts, (one or) two singers, and (at least one) accompanist needed  
  * Get the name of some niche occupation or topic from the audience  
  * The hosts introduce the infomercial, the CD, and banter for a little  
  * Eventually, the hosts give a title of a song on the album, as well as its genre/artist  
  * The singer(s) then perform a short song based on the hosts’ premise  
  * This repeats one or two more times  
* Example:  
  * Hosts: “Someone give me an occupation you don’t encounter much.”  
  * Audience: “Taxidermist”  
  * Hosts: \*Introduce infomercial\*  
  * Hosts: “And who can forget that blues taxidermy hit, Way Too Stuffed”  
  * Singers: \*Sing a song based on genre and title\*  
  * \*Do one or two more songs\*  
* Notes:  
  * The hosts should be mindful of what genres/artists are able to played by the given accompanist(s).  
  * A singer should do backup vocals when not leading.  
  * The songs should get right to the point since they aren’t very long.  
  * The songs can be funny and/or impressive from a technical standpoint. The audience will enjoy either\!
