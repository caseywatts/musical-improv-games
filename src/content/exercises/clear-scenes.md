### CLEAR Robot Scenes \- 30-35 minutes

* Instructions  
  * Note that in musical improv, our scenes can be super basic\!  
    * Keith Estrella says “Musical Improv scenes are just doing fundamentals”  
  * What we were doing in “I am a tree” is very similar to starting a basic scene for musical improv.  
  * You don’t have to be clever, just think of what would “Yes and” what we know  
  * Point out any aspects of CLEAR they did already\!  
  * Facilitator introduces CLEAR scenes. CLEAR stands for:  
    * C \- Character  \- Who is in the scene  
    * L \- Location \- Where the scene takes place  
    * E \- Emotion \- How characters feel  
    * A \- Activity \- What are they physically doing?  
    * R \- Relationship \- How are they emotionally connected?   
      * How do they feel about each other  
  * Scenes are 2-3 minutes  
  * Facilitators will do an example CLEAR scene:  
    * Player 1: Character  
    * Player 2: Character  
    * Player 1: Location  
    * Player 2: Activity  
    * Player 1: Relationship  
    * Example:  
      * Player 1: Doctor  
      * Player 2: Doctor’s Receptionist  
      * Player 1: Front desk of the Doctor’s Office  
      * Player 2: Sorting paperwork  
      * Player 1: They’re a strong team united in their goal  
  * Afterward we’ll ask “What was our character, location, etc?”  
  * Round 1: Pairs  
    * Have them do robot scenes in PAIRS. Encourage each pair to take turns   
  * Round 2: Heroes/Villains  
    * Add in that in this round characters are either both heroes or are both villains  
  * Round 3: On Stage  
    * Ask for a suggestion. Remind them to A to C  
    * They’ll perform 2-minute more-natural scenes, talking to each other  
  * Challenge: Ask the audience to raise their hands when they think the people in the scene have hit all 5 CLEAR  
  * Challenge: Get to CLEAR in as little time as possible. Make big choices.
