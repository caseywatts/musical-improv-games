### Hush, Little Baby

* Objective: Improvise a rhyming lullaby one line at a time based on a popular song  
* Instructions:   
  * Everyone stands in a circle formation, one person designated to start  
  * Get a suggestion of an object from someone in the circle  
  * Starting person says line similar to “Hush, Little Baby”, but with other object  
  * The next person, clockwise, builds off the line that was just said  
  * That next line should reference the previous object then mention a new object  
  * The next person, clockwise, does the same thing  
  * This clockwise, line-at-a-time, rotation continues for a while  
  * Eventually the song ends by someone holding their last note  
* Example:  
  * Singer 1: “Someone give me an object you’d find in your room.”  
  * Anyone: “A bed”  
  * Singer 1: “Hush little baby, rest your head; mama’s gonna buy you a new bed”  
  * Singer 2: “And if that bed don’t feel good, mama’s gonna buy you some firewood”  
  * Singer 3: “And if that firewood don’t burn, mama’s gonna buy you an urn”  
  * Singer 4: “And if that urn don’t hold the ash, mama’s gonna give you a mustache”  
  * Singer 1: “And if that mustache don’t trim well, mama’s gonna buy you a Dell”  
  * Singer 2: “And if that Dell don’t download files, mama’s gonna buy you floor tiles”  
  * The rotation keeps going until someone holds their last note.  
* Notes:  
  * If you want to prepare beforehand, it’s best to have the object in mind so that you know what you will rhyme with; then work backwards to figure out what word could be used to set you up for that rhyme.  
  * If you fall out of rhythm, take your time to finish your line; others will adjust.
