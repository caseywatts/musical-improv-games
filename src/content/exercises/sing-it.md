### Sing It\! \- 15-20 minutes

* First, show an example. Then, have students go on stage two at a time:  
* Instructions:  
* Two people get a word and perform a scene.   
* Once the scene is CLEAR, someone in the class calls “Sing it\!” on a line they want to hear as a chorus  
* Pianist begins music  
* The character with the last spoken line then sings it as a 4-line chorus  
* Everyone repeats the chorus (structure \= CC).  
* Challenge: If you’re in the scene, try to signal a “button line” that would make a good chorus
