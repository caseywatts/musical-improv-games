* Introductions:  
  * Brainstorming: Facilitators will ask the class to think of something good that’s happened this week/month/year  
  * Demonstrate: Facilitators introduce the “chorus” melody of Tom’s Diner using the vowel “Doo”  
  * Together: Ask the entire group to sing the melody with you, and repeat the chorus with them.  
  * Example Verse: Facilitators will introduce examples of singing to that same “verse melody” with made up words.   
    * Note that it’s the SAME melody as the chorus.  
  * Each person shares their own verse. Between each person’s verse, everyone does the chorus together (“Doo”).
