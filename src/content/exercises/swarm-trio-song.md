Objective:

* Perform a fast-paced scene that jumps between three distinct groups of people in the same location, showing different perspectives or points of view (POVs).   
* After establishing the three groups, players will split into the 3 separate groups to sing a trio

Important Note:  
Approach the scene with a “90% Yes/10% And” mentality. Build on and agree with the previous ideas as a unified group. Focus on creating and heightening the distinct perspectives of each group. KEEP IT SIMPLE\! Simple and silly can be effective and fun.

Instructions:

* Players start unified, moving as a tight group (like “peas in a pod”) to quickly establish three different groups in the same location.  
* Use short statements to showcase build the group's perspective.  
* Players move quickly as a swarm, transitioning between the three groups (Group A \> Group B \> Group A \> Group B \> Group C), each with its own POV or dynamic.  
* Each group should speak at or about the other groups, highlighting their differences, but avoid splitting into dialogue between groups.  
* Once the three groups have been established and revisited, the improvisers will split from the swarm into three groups

The accompanist will begin playing music. Each group selects one person to establish a chorus or chant based on their POV.

The three choruses will then overlap

Recommended pattern:  
Group A\> Group B\> Group A\> Group B \> Group C

After establishing and heightening the dynamics, the players split into three groups for the song

Examples:

The Mall:  
Group A: Players start stage left as over-excited teenagers running through the mall, obsessing over sales and selfies.

Group B: Players move stage right to be exhausted mall employees, grumbling about difficult customers.

Group A: Back to the teenagers, now frantic about finding the perfect item.

Group B: Back to the employees, even more exhausted, gossiping about specific shoppers.

Group C: Players rush center stage to be mall security guards, confused and trying to maintain order.

Song finale:  
Group A: "Sales, sales, sales\!" X4  
Group B: "End this shift\!" X4  
Group C: "Security’s on it\!" X4  
Overlap to end

A Kids' Soccer Game:  
Group A: Players start stage left as overly competitive soccer parents, cheering too loudly and shouting advice.

Group B: Players move stage right to be the disinterested kids, more focused on the grass than the game.

Group A: Back to the parents, now even more intense, treating it like a championship.

Group B: Return to the kids, still distracted and barely playing.

Group C: Players move center stage to be the overwhelmed referee, struggling to control the game.

Song finale:  
Group A: "Go, go, go\!"  
Group B: "We don’t care\!"  
Group C: "Stay in line\!"

The Neighborhood:  
Group A: Players start stage left as nosy neighbors, spying on everyone and gossiping.

Group B: Players move stage right to be mischievous kids causing trouble around the neighborhood.

Group A: Back to the neighbors, getting even more suspicious and accusing everyone of wrongdoing.

Group B: Back to the kids, now planning an even bigger prank.

Group C: Players move center stage to be the overwhelmed mail carrier, trying to avoid the drama.

Song finale:  
Group A: "Did you see that?"  
Group B: "Let’s cause trouble\!"  
Group C: "Just deliver the mail\!"

Notes:  
The overlapping choruses should reflect each group’s unique POV and add to the humor of the scene.

Fast transitions, strong group energy, and commitment to character are key to making the scene.

The scene can work with exactly three players or larger groups
