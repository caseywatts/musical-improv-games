### Werewolves of London

* Instructions:   
  * Four singing improvisers and one accompanist needed   
  * The singers stand side to side facing the audience and get an activity  
  * Each person sings a verse with an ABCB rhyme scheme  
* Example:  
  * Singer 1: “Can I get an example of a type of activity?”  
  * Audience: “Playing kickball”  
  * \*Accompanist starts playing melody\*  
  * Every singer: “Ah-ooooh werewolves of London, Ah-ooooooooh, Ah-ooooh werewolves of London, Ah-ooooooooh”  
  * Singer 1: “I saw a werewolf playing kickball the other day”  
  * Singer 1: “Almost had to draw my sword from its sheath”  
  * Singer 1: “But before I even knew what was going on”  
  * Singer 1: “That guy popped the kickball with his teeth”  
  * Every singer: “Ah-ooooh werewolves of London, Ah-ooooooooh, Ah-ooooh werewolves of London, Ah-ooooooooh”  
  * Singer 2: “Accidentally kicked my kickball into the neighbor’s yard”  
  * Singer 2: “Said I was sorry, I didn’t mean to get all up in his space”  
  * Singer 2: “We got in a screaming match and he started to transform”  
  * Singer 2: “Then he scratched me with his damn claws all over my face”  
  * \*Keep singing chorus and then new verse until all players have gone\*  
* Notes:  
  * Think of the words you want to rhyme with first, then work backwards to think what your whole lines should be.  
  * Each person should try to focus on different aspects of the given activity.
