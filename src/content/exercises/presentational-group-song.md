### Presentation Group Game

* Objective:   
  * Perform a group song with musical accompaniment where players address the audience as if they are in a specific role or scenario in a presentation-style.

* Note: Approach the Group Scene with a “90% Yes/10% And” mentality. Aim to build on and agree with previous ideas. Identify who the audience is and who the group on stage is and run withit. Remember: KEEP IT SIMPLE\! Simple and silly can be effective and fun.

Instructions:

* All players will participate in groups of any size, at least 2 or 3, and bigger is better\!  
* A player starts by asking the audience for a suggestion of a genre or scenario.  
* A player will step out and clearly establish a scenario for the audience, creating a presentation such as a commercial, talk, or speech.   
* The accompanist plays background music that matches the given genre or situation. The accompanist joins in after the first player has started.  
* Example initiations: “Thank you for coming out, employees. As your c suite execs, we're glad you could attend our mandatory all-hands meeting.”   
* Note: Identify who the audience is and who the group on stage is.

Other players join and face the audience, treating them as a different group, such as school kids, executives, home viewers, or conference attendees. 

Scenarios can include things like:

* An infomercial presenting a new product to home viewers on their couch. “Hey viewers on your couches, we have a product you'll love\!”  
* A TED Talk delivered to an audience at a conference. “Thanks for coming to our group TED Talk, everyone\!”  
* A motivational speech aimed at employees from their boss. “Team, we’re here to inspire you and get you motivated for the big project ahead\!”  
* A classroom lesson addressed to students. “All of your teachers are here to talk to you 5th graders about something important.”  
* A TV show segment talking to viewers. “Welcome back to our show, folks\! Today, we’re diving into the latest trends\!”

After Player 1 establishes the scenario, the other players perform a short, spoken scene related to the scenario, where they mention they have written a little jingle. 

* The group then performs the short song or jingle related to the scenario, with each player singing about two lines. They should harmonize and stay in character throughout the performance.

* At the end, the group finds a repeated part of the song or jingle to sing together, using a simple, memorable phrase of 1 to 5 words.

* More examples suggestions in case you have trouble thinking of them:   
* You could be in a cooking show, weather report , sports commenters, tech inventors (like an apple keynote), book club recruiters, historians presenting a topic, Royal family.   
* The audience focused suggestions: audience is:  
* Demons trying to communicate with psychics, students at a magic school, teaching adults about life, ghosts giving advice to the living, cavemen explaining technology to scientists, cats presenting to dog owners, dinosaurs training zoo keepers, monsters teaching humans how to scare, aliens talking to human, fairytale creatures guiding tourists, robots explaining emotions to humans, zombies pitching a wellness program.

* Player 3 continues with: “Just look at it spin, it’s cleaning with a win\!”  
* Player 4: “And guess what? We even wrote a jingle for you\!”  
* Player 3 continues with the jingle: “Introducing the Super-Mop 3000, it’s the mop you’ve been waiting for\!”  
* Player 4 adds: “Just look at it spin, it’s cleaning with a win\!”  
* The group finishes with the repeated line as a chorus: “Super-Mop 3000\!”

* Player 3: “We’ve researched the benefits extensively, and the results are extraordinary\!”  
* Player 4 continues: “And to make it memorable, we even wrote a little song to illustrate our point\!”  
* A player eventually: “We even wrote a little song to illustrate our point\!”  
* Player 3 sings: “Wear your socks on hands, productivity will rise\!”  
* Player 4 continues: “Typing, eating, and more, sock hands are the new score\!”  
* The group ends with the repeated line: “Sock hands win\!”
