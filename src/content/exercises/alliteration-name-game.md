* Spelling names is another way to help ourselves remember.   
* \*INCLUSIVITY:   
  * Remind participants to take care of themselves and adjust accordingly to be physically comfortable in this exercise.    
  * Facilitators can offer accommodations for participants who might be uncomfortable/unable to shake out limbs   
  * (participate while seated, snap fingers/tap toes, wiggle shoulders/wiggle knees, etc.)
