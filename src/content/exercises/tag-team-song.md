### Tag Team Song

* Objective: Improvise a whole song while changing places with increasing frequency  
* Instructions:   
  * Three singers and accompanist needed, optional mic stand  
  * Get any type of suggestion from the audience (location, object, emotion, event)  
  * Accompanist starts playing some music  
  * One of the three singers starts singing the song  
  * When one of the other two singers feels inspired, they tag the main singer out  
  * The one who tagged takes center stage (and the mic) and continues the song  
  * As the song goes on, tags should be more frequent and physically exaggerated  
  * Eventually the song ends with all singers singing the same last word  
* Example:  
  * Singer 1: “Someone tell me the location of the last date you went on.”  
  * Audience: “The park”  
  * Accompanist starts playing music and Singer 1 steps up to the mic  
  * Singer 1: “I love the park, it’s where I go to…”  
  * Singer 2 tags Singer 1 on the shoulder and they physically switch places  
  * Singer 2: “... be with my favorite girl\! When we…”  
  * Singer 3 tags in  
  * Singer 3: “frolic through that grass…”  
  * This keeps happening more and more until the last word is sung.  
  * All 3 Singers: “Todayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy\!\!” (or whatever the word is)  
* Notes:  
  * As the song progresses, tags should generally happen more often.  
  * It is also more entertaining if the later tags are more likely to happen mid-word or in the middle of a phrase, or during a long note.  
  * Really lean into physicality as the song progresses. Make your movements quicker, sharper, and goofier.  
  * It is more impressive when rhyming occurs, but it’s not a requirement.

  * This team uses 3 people, but it can be played with 2, 3, or possibly 4 people
