### Build a Band

### Objective: To create a rhythmic symphony together using complementary sounds and movements.

### 

### Instructions: 

### The group stands in a circle. One by one, each player fades in, making a sound and movement that imitates an instrument, complementing the sounds of others.

### The game progresses as each player takes a turn performing a "BIG Solo" in the center of the circle.

### Participants are encouraged to keep it simple and contribute without trying to stand out too much.

### Facilitator may intervene to demonstrate or guide solos, especially in the first round.

### Feedback can include notes on timing, teamwork, and making bold solo choices.

### 

### Example:

### Round 1: Players slowly join in with a simple rhythm, mimicking different instruments.

### Round 2: Players take turns performing their solos while the group supports.

### Notes: Encourage bold, confident movements, even if they feel silly. Fake confidence if needed.

### Purpose: To build confidence in performing as a group and encourage creative risk-taking.
