### Discussion Melody \- 5 minutes

* Ask the group for their takeaways and thoughts.  
* Discussion points:  
  * LISTEN AND RESPOND: One way to create a new melody is to listen to the previous melody and respond to it with a new idea. Varying the rhythm, pitch, or overall feel   
  * EXPERIMENT WITH DIFFERENT SOUNDS: Experiment with different sounds and vocalizations when creating their melodies. This could involve using different vowel sounds, consonants, or even animal noises to create interesting and unexpected melodies.  
  * PLAY WITH REPETITION: Repetition of pitch and rhythm can be a powerful tool in creating melodies. Experiment with repeating certain sounds or phrases to create a sense of structure or continuity in their melody.  
  * FOLLOW THE FEELING: Sometimes the best way to create a melody is to simply follow the feeling of the music and let it guide you. Tap into your intuition and allow their melodies to evolve naturally in response to the piano accompaniment and the group energy.  
  * TAKE RISKS: Finally, this is an improv game, and there are no wrong answers\! Take risks and try new things when creating melodies, and embrace the unexpected twists and turns that can arise as a result.
