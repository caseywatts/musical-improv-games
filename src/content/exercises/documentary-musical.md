Documentary Musical

Objective: Create a musical documentary-style interview with two players based on a suggestion, featuring a song in any format.

Version 1 involves a straightforward approach where two players perform a brief documentary interview based on a suggestion from the audience. They begin with a simple introduction and then transition into a duet, singing a song in any format while remaining in character.

Version 2 is a full set. It starts with a documentary interview similar to Version 1, but involves multiple documentaries. After each pair finishes their interview, they are tagged out by new pairs. Each documentary answers the same basic questions but with different subjects or angles. After showcasing all planned documentaries, the scene transitions to "time dash" songs where each topic is revisited in a musical format. The songs reflect the development of each documentary's subject, and all characters remain in their roles.

Version 1

Instructions:

1\. Set-Up: As a player asks the audience for a suggestion, the back line places two chairs upstage center, side by side and touching.

2\. First Documentary: A player steps out to start the documentary. The second player joins them. They sit in the chairs and talk "to camera." Begin with a gift line like “We are…” or “My best friend here…” to set the scene. The documentary style involves answering questions such as “Who are you?” and “Why are we interviewing you about (SUGGESTION)?”

3\. Song: After the initial interview, perform a duet in any musical format (verse-chorus, tagline, etc.) that reflects the topic or theme of the documentary. The song should be related to the content discussed during the interview. Players stay in character throughout the song.

4\. Sweep Edit: After the song, perform a sweep edit to transition out.

Examples:

Example 1: Haunted Mansion Tour

Player 1: “We are the tour guides for this haunted mansion.”

Player 2 joins: “My best friend here will show you the spookiest rooms.”

They describe the mansion’s eerie features. After the interview, perform a duet in any format about the haunted mansion, with players staying in character and focusing on its spooky aspects.

Example 2: Extreme Sports Championship

Player 1: “We are extreme sports champions discussing our favorite stunts.”

Player 2 joins: “My best friend here has the most insane tricks to show you.”

They answer questions about their sports achievements. After the interview, perform a duet in any format about recent thrilling events or competitions in extreme sports, with players maintaining their extreme sports personas.

Example 3: Underwater Research Team

Player 1: “We are underwater researchers exploring deep-sea creatures.”

Player 2 joins: “My best friend here has discovered some incredible species.”

They explain their findings and experiences. After the interview, perform a duet in any format about new discoveries or challenges faced underwater, with players staying in character as researchers.

Version 2: Documentary Musical

Objective: Create a series of musical documentary-style interviews based on a suggestion, featuring players in different documentary scenarios with musical improv.

Instructions:

1\. Set-Up: As someone asks the audience for a suggestion, the back line places two chairs in the upstage centerstage area, side by side, touching.

2\. First Documentary: A player steps out to start the first documentary. The second player joins them. They sit in the chairs and talk "to camera." Begin with a gift line like “We are…” or “My best friend here…” to set the scene. The documentary style involves answering questions such as “Who are you?” and “Why are we interviewing you about (SUGGESTION)?”

3\. Tag-Ins: A player from the backline tags in, and the players in the chairs move to a different documentary scenario. A new second player joins the new documentary. Note: The tag-ins are not musical.

4\. Number of Documentaries: Present as many documentaries as there are players to feature each player once. For example, if there are 6 players, present 3 documentaries. If there are 7 players, present 4 documentaries. Continue this pattern accordingly.

5\. Time Dash Song: After the planned number of documentaries, show a time dash for each documentary where a few moments have passed. During each time dash, present a song in any format (verse-chorus, tagline, etc.) that highlights key moments or developments since the initial interview. Each song should star the original players from the documentary.

Notes: Keep each documentary short and focused. Ensure smooth transitions and engaging musical numbers. Use time dashes to show progression and changes effectively.

Example

2\. First Documentary:  
Player 1 steps out and starts the first documentary. Player 2 joins them. They sit in the chairs and Player 1 begins:  
“We are the leading experts in garden gnomes.”  
Player 2:  
“My best friend here has been making gnomes for over 20 years. We’re here to explain why gnomes are essential for every garden.”  
Etc  
3\. Tag-Ins:  
Player 3 tags in and Player 1 and 2 move out. Player 3 and Player 4 sit in the chairs and start a new documentary:  
“We’re here with the top chefs in town to talk about their favorite ingredients\!”  
Player 4   
“And we’re excited to share why truffle oil is the secret to gourmet cooking.”

4\. Number of Documentaries:  
If there are 6 players total, we would see 3 documentaries. Each player gets a turn to be in one.

5\. Time Dash Song:  
After all documentaries are complete, show a time dash for each. For example:

After the documentary, we see a time dash for each topic. For the garden gnomes:

Player 1 “Since our last interview, we’ve expanded our collection to include mythical creatures”

Player 2 “The gnomes have really taken off. We’re even getting requests for custom designs”

Chrous “Gnomes Take Over”

For the chefs:

Player 3 “Our new truffle oil recipe has gone viral”  
Player 4 “We’ve been invited to cook at a top food festival”

Chorus “Truffle Triumph”
