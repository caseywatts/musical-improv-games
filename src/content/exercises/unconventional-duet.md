### Unconventional Duet

* Objective: Have two pairs of people play two characters that are singing to each other  
* Instructions:   
  * Four singing improvisers and a piano player are needed  
  * The four singers split into two pairs that stand on opposite sides of the stage  
  * Get a relationship and/or subject matter that two people could sing about  
  * Each pair of singers plays the role of a single character in the scene  
  * One pair sings a word at a time, the other pair sings simultaneously  
  * The two pairs take turns singing to each other until the scene naturally ends  
* Example:  
  * \*Singers 1 & 2 stand together stage left, singers 3 & 4 stand together stage right\*  
  * Singer 1: “Can I get an example of a relationship between two people?”  
  * Audience: “Doctor and patient”  
  * \*Accompanist starts playing music\*  
  * Singer 1: “You”  
  * Singer 2: “Took”  
  * Singer 1: “My”  
  * Singer 2: “Blood”  
  * Singer 1: “Pressure”  
  * Singer 2: “So”  
  * Singer 1: “Well”  
  * Singers 3 & 4: “I am diagnosing you with a case of attractiveness”  
  * \*this back and forth continues until the song comes to an end\*  
* Notes:  
  * Make sure to focus your lyrics on the relationship and/or subject matter.  
  * Incorporate physicality, especially when mixed with emotion, to make up for the fact that you are all stationary.  
  * For the word at a time pair, avoid filler words or words that delay conveying useful/fun information.  
  * For the simultaneous pair, it helps to look at each other and annunciate.  
  * Though it makes it harder, try to sing quickly; it adds to the fun quite a lot.
