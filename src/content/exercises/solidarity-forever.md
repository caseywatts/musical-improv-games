### Solidarity Forever

* Objective: Each person sings a three-line-rhyming verse about a unionized profession  
* Instructions:   
  * Four singing improvisers and one accompanist needed  
  * The singers stand side to side facing the audience and get a profession  
  * Each person sings a verse with an AAAX rhyme scheme, where X is a known line  
* Example:  
  * Singer 1: “Can I get an occupation?”  
  * Audience: “Mechanic”  
  * \*Accompanist starts playing melody\*  
  * Every singer: “Soooolidarity foreeeever, Soooolidarity foreeeever, Soooolidarity foreeeever, For the union makes us stroooong”  
  * Singer 1: “I will fix any problem on any car in any place”  
  * Singer 1: “I will crawl around in every single teeny tiny space”  
  * Singer 1: “There are no car troubles that we cannot face”  
  * Singer 1: “Because the union makes us strong”  
  * Every singer: “Soooolidarity foreeeever, Soooolidarity foreeeever, Soooolidarity foreeeever, For the union makes us stroooong”  
  * Singer 2: “Once I’m finished with your car, I promise everything will be great”  
  * Singer 2: “I work at the finest damn repair shop in the entire state”  
  * Singer 2: “Just like a healthy juice, I’ll make sure you have a V8”  
  * Singer 2: “For the union makes us strong”  
  * \*Keep singing chorus and then new verse until all players have gone\*  
* Notes:  
  * People that are more comfortable with rhyming should go first.  
  * Think of the words you want to rhyme with first, then work backwards to think what your whole lines should be.  
  * Each person should try to focus on different aspects of the given profession.
