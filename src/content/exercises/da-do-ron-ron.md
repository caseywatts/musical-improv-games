### DA DO RON RON ELIMINATION

* Instructions:   
  * Players in a circle or in a line that cycles around  
  * Explain that players take turns offering a new original rhyme in the rhythm of the song. Each new verse continues the same AAAAA rhyme scheme Example  
  * Example  
    * Player A: “I met him on a Monday, and his name was Pete.”  
      * Everyone: “Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron”  
    * Player B: “He was so suave he knocked me off my feet.”  
      * Everyone: “Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron. Yeah\!”  
    * Player C:“He kissed so sweet.  
      * Everyone: “Yeah”  
    * Player D:“He dressed so neat.”  
      * Everyone:“Yeah\!”  
    * Player E:“He was so discreet.”  
      * Everyone:“Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron.”  
    * The song continues to the next verse with a new rhyme  
    * The song should get faster over time (it probably will naturally anyway)  
    * This continues until someone can’t produce a rhyme  
    * When someone fails they are eliminated, and a new song starts  
    * This goes until just one person survives, and they are the winner  
* Notes:  
  * Remember to let the song get faster and faster as a round goes on  
  * When starting off the rhyme, don’t purposefully use an unrhymable word just to spite others.
