The Midnight Society Opening:

Objective: To create an engaging and collaborative spooky story through group participation and scenic moments, with an optional musical variant.

Instructions:

Get a suggestion of anything at all.

Form a Crescent of Doom by having players stand in an arch formation.

A player starts by announcing they have a scary story to share. They give the basic premise in one or two lines.

Other players add to the story, behaving as if it’s the scariest story ever.

Once the basic story is set, two player steps out. They perform a three to four line scene that advances the plot.

Optionally, after the scene, the 2 players can break into a musical number. They sing a four-line chorus about the story. The ensemble repeats the chorus.

Return to the Crescent of Doom. Another player introduces a new scary story based on the original suggestion.

Tell a total of three stories.

Remember to comment on the new details discovered after each little scene.

At the end of the third story, everyone says together: "Submitted for the approval of the Midnight Society, we give you... (SUGGESTION)\!"

Example:

Round 1: A player announces a story about a haunted mirror. Other players add spooky elements. 

A scenic moment shows the mirror revealing a ghost. Optionally, players sing a chorus like “Haunted Mirror” or “Ghostly Reflections,” which the ensemble repeats.

Round 2: Another player introduces a story about a cursed doll. The scene involves a child receiving the doll as a gift. 

A musical number follows with a chorus like “Cursed Doll” or “Doll’s Curse.”

Round 3: A final story is about a mysterious, disappearing bridge. The scene shows people trying to cross the bridge only for it to vanish. 

The ensemble sings a chorus like “Vanishing Bridge” or “Bridge of Shadows.”
